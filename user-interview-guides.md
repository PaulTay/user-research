# Interview Guidelines

### For Moderator

- Give some context but not too much, encourage honesty.
- Avoid leading or closed questions.
- Probe behaviour and not intention.
- An interview should feel like a natural conversation to your user.
- Avoid agreeing or disagreeing with the user.
- Avoid talking about yourself.
- Avoid explaining the way the product should be.
- Be careful about paraphrasing / finishing sentences / putting words into user mouth.
- Leave space for silence. Pause after you say something. Pause after they say something. Donâ€™t jump to the next question immediately.
- A little vagueness is okay.
- Focus on specifics. Ask to give examples if statement is too vague. Questions to clarify assumptions:
    - Why is it cool?
    - How is it helpful?
    - How will this change what you do today?
    - Can give me an example of how you would use this?
    - Tell me more about ...
    - What do you mean by that?
    - What did you expect to happen?
    - Why do you do that?
    - How do you feel about that?
    - How often does that happen?
- Speak clearly and confidently.
