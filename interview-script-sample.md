# Interview Script

Hi, I’m [Paul], and sitting next to me are [Vanessa] and note-taker [Wen Wen].

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today!

We’re doing a little research on [student experience with the school's student portal], and we want to learn more about [the other student portals] that [tertiary education students] use throughout [your student life].

We wanted to have a quick conversation with you today and ask you about your experiences as a [student]. Our talk shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.

Do you mind if we record this call for our notes? The recording won’t be published or shared outside our team, it just helps us with our notetaking.

(Wait for confirmation before turning on the recording. If the participant doesn’t agree to the recording, continue without it.)

Great! To get started, could you think back to the last time you [use student portal] and walk through the steps you took?

(To get started, get the participant to start describing some aspect of how they use whatever you’re studying. As the interview progresses, draw from your list of prepared probe questions. Use clarifying questions to gather more details around things they say. Don’t be afraid to ask about something you haven’t written down if they say something interesting.)

That’s it for my questions. Is there anything else that you’d like to add that I haven’t asked you about?

(Give the participant a chance to respond.)

Thank you so much for taking the time to have this conversation about [your experience with student portal]. Your input has been very helpful.

Here's a token of appreciation from us for coming over for this session.

Thank you again for your time!
