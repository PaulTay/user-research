# Interview Script

Hi, I’m [Paul], and sitting next to me are [Vanessa] and note-taker [Wen Wen].

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today!

We’re doing a little research on [student portal / student services available in other institutions], and we want to learn more about student experiences using them.

We wanted to have a quick conversation with you today and ask you about your personal experiences as a [student]. Our talk shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.

Do you mind if we record this call for our notes? The recording won’t be published or shared outside our team, it just helps us with our notetaking.

(Wait for confirmation before turning on the recording. If the participant doesn’t agree to the recording, continue without it.)

Also, can you tell us where you are studying and what you are studying?

Great! To get started, could you think back to the last time you [use student portal] and walk through the steps you took to access the system? 

(To get started, get the participant to start describing some aspect of how they use whatever you’re studying. As the interview progresses, draw from your list of prepared probe questions. Use clarifying questions to gather more details around things they say. Don’t be afraid to ask about something you haven’t written down if they say something interesting.)

- What are the things that you have done via student portal / student online services? Probe why.
- How did you do this? Detailed steps. 
- What is the one thing that you try to get done most often using student portal? 
- What were the steps you took to get to the student portal and then what did you do?
- How often do you use student portal? What kind of circumstances will make you to checkout student portal?
- Can you show us the top 5 things that you will do using student portal?
- What could be better about how you do this? Can you show me what's frustrating about the current process?
- Describe a positive experience you have with university website / student online services. (Be careful of false positive, see IG11)


That’s it for my questions. Is there anything else that you’d like to add that I haven’t asked you about?

(Give the participant a chance to respond.)
